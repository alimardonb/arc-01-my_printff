# Welcome to My Printf


 ## Usage 
 1.Include the my_printf function in your project by copying the provided code into your source code file.
 2.Call the my_printf function in your code to print formatted text.

 To use my_printf, include the my_printf.h header file in your C program and call the my_printf function with the desired format string and arguments through Makefile.
 
 ## Installation
 
 To use my_printf in your project, place the my_printf.c and my_printf.о  files in your project directory. Include my_printf.о  in your source file where you intend to use the my_printf function.
 
 To use my_printf in your project, place the my_printf.c and my_printf.h files in your project directory. Include my_printf.h in your source file where you intend to use the my_printf function.
 ## Task
 
 The task involves implementing a custom printf-like function (my_printf) that can handle various format specifiers such as %d, %s, %c, %p, %x, %o, etc., and correctly format and display the output according to these specifiers.
 ## Description
 
 The `my_printf` function produces output based on a format string, similar to the standard `printf`. The format string consists of ordinary characters, copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications introduced by the PERCENT character (%). Conversion specifications fetch subsequent arguments for output.
